What is state?
In props  the data comes outside the component

But what we need to hold data in component?And what if we want to the change the UI as result of an action?
We use "STATE"

STATE IS THE DATA THAT THE COMPONENT CAN HOLD OVER TIME WITH NECESSARY INFORMATION
Eg of STATE:Notification count
            text content of an input field
            active tab in tab component
 Other eg:so when we click on a tab it becomes active
 when we read the notfications no.of notifications will decrease

When we updating the state it will re-render that component UI(Updated View of that particular component)

Data is always is in sync with UI and this done using state

Adding state to a component is done in 3 steps
1.1st we add  new state variable
2. We use it in a code ..that is usually JSX
3.We update the state in event handler

1.add new state variable
useState(1)//here we are creating a new state variable and useState is a function and we pass in default parameter ie 1
useState will return an array
We get 2 values in console
0:1 (default STATE)
1.f (f is a function where we update the state variable)        

const[step,setStep]=useState//destructuring
//[step] is 1
//setStep is function

2. using step in jsx
<div className={`${step >=1 ?`active`:""}}`>1</div>

3.updating the state in eventhandler

useState is hook..we can identify hooks as it satrts with "use" keyword
we can only call hooks "useState" on top level of the function

State is like memory of the component..eventhough we 1 and 2 is selected..if we close and open the component..it will still show the 2nd number message
